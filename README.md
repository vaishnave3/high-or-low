#### This app was completely created using ReactJs

# Features of the app :
- Randomly renders any two movies from the IMDb top 250 list.
- Behind the scenes, it checks if the value of the selected movie is indeed higher, then updates the score. Else, you lose.
- Uses rapid api for getting the titles and information (highly recommend)
- Some URLs are broken, in that case, I re-generate a random movie.

# Extra work that I did :
- Copied the source code from IMDb's page and wrote a python script to get titles using regex and stored it.
- The script and file can be found in assets.

### Please feel free to fork it and help me with the CSS as it is not at all mobile responsive, thanks in advance.
